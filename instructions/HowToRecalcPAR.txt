How To Correct/Recalculate PAR Data from the raw sensor volts in the DAC code:

For a recalculation of the PAR values from the raw sensor volts in the 
m_bsipar_sensor_volts sensor:
Edit the JSON entry for PAR in sensor_defs.json for that deployment to 
look like:

    "corrected_par": {
        "attrs": {
            "_FillValue": NaN,
            "accuracy": " ",
            "ancillary_variables": "instrument_par",
            "comment": "PAR has been recalculated from the raw voltage due to the glider miscalculating PAR.",
            "instrument": "instrument_par",
            "long_name": "Photosynthetically Active Radiation",
            "observation_type": "measured",
            "OOI_data_product_name": "OPTPARW",
            "OOI_data_level": "L1a",
            "platform": "platform",
            "precision": " ",
            "resolution": " ",
            "standard_name": "downwelling_photosynthetic_photon_spherical_irradiance_in_sea_water",
            "units": "umol m-2 s-1",
            "valid_max": 6000.0,
            "valid_min": 0.0,
            "sensor_dark": 0.0109,  # = 10.9 mV -> 0.0109 V
            "scale_factor": 5.786E-04
        },
        "dimension": "time",
        "nc_var_name": "PAR",
        "type": "f8"
    },
    
where the name of the entry is changed from "sci_bsipar_par" to "corrected_par"
and the "sensor_dark" and "scale_factor" entries are added to the "attrs"
dictionary. The "scale_factor" entry is the Wet value (uE/m^2sec) in the
Calibration Scale Factor section from the relevant calibration certificate
for this deployment.  The "sensor_dark" entry is the Sensor Dark value under
the Sensor Output Voltage section from the relevant calibration certificate
converted from mVolts to Volts.
The "comment" entry in "attrs" has also been added, but is not required.
