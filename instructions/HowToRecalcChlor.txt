How To Correct/Recalculate Chlorophyll Data from raw signal counts in the DAC code:

For a recalculation of Chlorophyll from raw instrument signal counts
according to the manual and calibration certificate for the WETLabs 
ECO Puck FLBBCD:
Edit the chlorophyll section JSON entry in sensor_defs.json for the 
deployment you want to recalculate to look like:
    "corrected_chlor": {
        "attrs": {
            "_FillValue": NaN,
            "accuracy": " ",
            "ancillary_variables": "instrument_flbbcd",
            "comment": "Chlorophyll recalculated from signal using calibration parameters due to incorrect parameters used during deployment",
            "instrument": "instrument_flbbcd",
            "long_name": "Chlorophyll Concentration",
            "observation_type": "measured",
            "OOI_data_product_name": "CHLAFLO",
            "OOI_data_level": "L1a",
            "platform": "platform",
            "precision": " ",
            "resolution": "0.012",
            "standard_name": "mass_concentration_of_chlorophyll_a_in_sea_water",
            "units": "ug l-1",
            "valid_max": 50.0,
            "valid_min": 0.0,
            "dark_offset": 45,
            "scale_factor": 0.0070
        },
        "dimension": "time",
        "nc_var_name": "chlorophyll",
        "type": "f8"
    },

where the name of the entry is changed from "sci_flbbcd_chlor" to 
"corrected_chlor" and the "dark_offset" and "scale_factor" (ug/L/counts)
entries are added to the "attrs" dictionary. The "dark_offset" entry is
the "Dark Counts" value and the "scale_factor" entry is the "Scale Factor"
value found in the ECO Chlorophyll Fluoromter Characterization Sheet
from the relevant calibration certificate for this deployment.

The "comment" entry under "attrs" here has also been added for this
example, but is not required.
