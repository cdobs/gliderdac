* if m_depth_state is included in the data file, this code will include hovering
 as a profile for those deployments that may have a hover built into the mission
 if they include significant lengths of science data in them .  This would also
 include time on the surface if there are significant lengths of science data
 in them.  The caveat to this is that any user that automatically assumes that
 a profile means a dive or a climb might run into trouble.  However, I think
 the worst of this is that a script might produce some plots with a lot of
 data aggregated to a small depth range.
