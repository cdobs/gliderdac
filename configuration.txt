A document to describe how to configure the glider dac software.

dba_file_sorter.py
    * has a sort function that uses a regex that follows OOI or Slocum glider
    data convention.  Regex must be changed if filename format is different
    * nevermind, the sorter function seems like it needs to be unique to the
    filename convention

profile_filters.py
    * these functions are filtering functions to separate out profiles and
    ultimately remove them based on:
        1. no science data present within the profile
        2. science data ratio (length of time of science data compared to length
         of time of the whole profile) is smaller than a threshold (default is
         1%)
        3. total length of science data time is less than a threshold (default 5
         minutes)
    * these are changeable, or can add your own to this file as long as the
    function name has the prefix "filter_" since the code that filters
    them finds all the functions in this module that have that prefix.
        * input to a new filter function must be a GliderData object instance
        that is a profile.  The GliderData class is coded in data_classes if you
        need to see how the methods and attributes available to that object.

## These below have yet to be implemented ##

configuration.py
    * edit configurations in this file. There is a global config, and then a
    local master config and then deployment config.  Each lower level overwrites
    the higher level one.

global_attributes.json
    * similar to above, there is a default one, and there can be a deployment
    one that overwrites any default ones

sensor_defs.json
    * similar to above, there is a default one, and there can be a deployment
    one that overwrites any default ones

deployment.json
    * similar to above, there is a global one, but there must be a deployment
    specific one too.

instrument.json
    * similar to above, there is a global one, but there must be a deployment
    specific one too.
